# Notes on using/defining Schemas

This document outlines some potential gotchas when using and consuming the Schemas defined in this library as well as
some samples below to help with understanding/advanced use cases.

The below links have information about the defining Schemas and how the validation is performed.

[JTD Schemas](https://jsontypedef.com/docs/jtd-in-5-minutes/) for requests and
responses validation (Via [AJV](https://ajv.js.org/json-type-definition.html)).

## Language

In this document it may use language such as:

- __MUST__ &rarr; this is something you always do
- __MUST NOT__ &rarr; this is something that you should never do
- __SHOULD__ &rarr; this is something that is a recommendation and generally is a good idea to follow to avoid issues

## Request/Response types vs single type

You may notice whilst the Schemas are being rolled out that the same object may be used for the request and the response.

However this may not be best practice and in the future it may be better to split out the request and the response
requests out to have different types.

On the request you would have an optional (i.e. `field?: string | null;`) property on the request.

Then on the response you could include the the field on the response as a required property (i.e. `field: string | null`).

This approach would allow you to introduce a new field with backwards compatibility immediately whilst you update
consumers to using the new type whilst also emitting the new property in responses.

## Gotchas

### Request/Response type name clash with defined types

When installing the Schemas using the LOKE cli tool if you have request/response objects that are not reference types 
(i.e. defined using `properties`, `optionalProperties` , etc) then the LOKE cli will create types for you in the
following format `MethodNameRequest` and `MethodNameResponse`.

When defining your types (in the `definitions` section) you __MUST NOT__ define a type that matches the above format.

For example if you had the following:

 ```typescript
 // implementation
interface CreateCustomerRequest {
  name: string;
}

interface Customer {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}

CreateCustomer({orgId: string; request: CreateCustomerRequest}): Promise<Customer>

// schema definition
{
  ...,
  definitions: {
    Customer: {
      properties: {
        id: { type: "string" }
        name: { type: "string" }
      }
    },
    CreateCustomerRequest: {
      properties: {
        name: { type: "string" }
      }
    }
  },
  methods: {
    CreateCustomer: {
      requestTypeDef: {
        properties: {
          orgId: {type: "string" }
          request: { ref: "CreateCustomerRequest" }
        }
      },
      responseTypeDef: { ref: "Customer" }
    }
  }
}
```

When installing the above with the LOKE cli it will generate the following types:

```typescript
// types created by definitions
export type CreateCustomerRequest = {
  name: string;
}

export type Customer {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}

// request type created by LOKE cli, response type is Customer above
export type CreateCustomerRequest = {
  orgId: string;
  request: CreateCustomerRequest
}
```

As you can see in the types above there are two `CreateCustomerRequest` types and this is invalid. To avoid this
you __MUST__ ensure that your type names never match the format generated by the LOKE cli.

If a better name for type cannot be determined you __SHOULD__ prefix or suffix the type name to avoid the clash.
Some examples that have been used are `Rpc` prefix or `Body` suffix but be consistent with existing code.

## Date response type

When using Schemas you __MUST_NOT__ use `Date` types in your request/response objects. Instead use strings formatted to
iso8601/rfc3339 (i.e. "2023-01-20T14:22:23Z") in your implementation and types and use `{ type: "timestamp" }` in the
Schema.

### Void response type

When using the new Schemas (and `serviceWithSchema`) it has been observed that returning a `void` return no longer
is acceptable as this then causes the request to fail in the `http-rpc-client` library due to the request not being
able to be converted to json.

If you are adding Schemas to existing rpc services you __MUST__ update any methods that return `void` to instead return
something or simply return `null` (including the typescript type for the method).

In the Schema method definition you simply do not define response and this will be converted to an `any` by the LOKE cli.

### Undefined response type

If a property from a rpc service is `field: string | undefined` as apposed to `field?: string` this may have issues
when defining the Schema. In the Schema definition to specify something as undefined is specifying that it is OPTIONAL.

When the intention is that the field is "blank", returning `null` instead of `undefined` __SHOULD__ be used
(i.e. `field: string | null`).

### Methods that have no request object

When methods have no request (this is very rare) then you simply do not define a request in the Schema definition.
This then gets set to an `any` by the LOKE cli.

_NOTE:_ When using the types generated by the LOKE cli in this cases you may have to pass an empty object as the request.

## Sample

Taking the typescript type see the sample included below.

```typescript

interface Location {
  name: string;
  maxPatrons: number;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  website: string | null;
  type: "FAST_FOOD" | "CAFE";
  tags: string[];
  hasDanceFloor: boolean;
  createdAt: string; // iso8601/rfc3339 timestamp string
  address: {
    streetAddress: string;
    locality: string;
    region: string;
    postalCode: string;
    country: string;
  } | null;
}

```

__NOTE:__ The below definition for numbers (both integer and floating point) are using the largest sizes available
and are not using signed vs unsigned values as are available in the JTD specification. Please use this example as a
guide and use the appropriate JTD property types as required.

You would define this type as follows in the schema

```js
{
  properties: {
    name: { type: "string" },
    maxPatrons: { type: "int32" },
    latitude: { type: "float32" },
    longitude: {type: "float32" },
    website: { type: "string", nullable: true },
    type: { enum: ["FAST_FOOD", "CAFE" ] },
    tags: { elements: { type: "string" } },
    hasDanceFloor: { type: "boolean" },
    createdAt: { type: "timestamp" },
    address: {
      properties: {
        streetAddress: { type: "string" },
        locality: { type: "string" },
        region: { type: "string" },
        postalCode: { type: "string" },
        country: { type: "string" }
      },
      nullable: true
    }
  }
}
```
